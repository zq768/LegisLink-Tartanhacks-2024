# LegisLink: Make your voices heard.

**"I want to see a change, but...what can I even accomplish on my own?**

Sound familiar? We all have changes we wish to see, but for various reasons, we abandon our hopes. It's not because you lack passion: you just haven't met enough people who share your ideas. 

LegisLink is a website connecting ordinary citizens with the right people.

# Our Mission: A Three-way Connection
- Forging connections between ordinary citizens with shared ideas
- Matching ideas with writers to draft the proposals out
- Linking them in the final step with policymakers, who can make these proposals come true

Through LegisLink, ordinary citizens can see posts, add reactions and supportive comments, and even reach out and join the drafting Groups. Groups work together to write up the ideas in a more formal manner. And in the final stages, policymakers are recommended to the writers, so they can contact them directly.

To facilitate the spread of ideas, LegisLink uses a content-based recommendation system to organize the users' feed based on their user history and self-identified areas of interests. The system gives tags to all posts and creates a similarity matrix with the users' preferences stored. Thus, this matrix can be updated every time the user clicks on a post and interacts. 

Attached is the Node.js code for a prototype of what the LegisLink website will be like. Additionally, there is a map system
